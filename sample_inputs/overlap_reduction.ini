# Overlap reduction runs are specified by INI sections "\[overlaps.[run name]\]". The overlap reduction run uses both
# particle and scaling moves to remove overlaps. If a move increases the number of overlaps it is always rejected, while
# move recuding overlaps are always accepted. On the other hand, when the number of overlaps does not change, the move
# is accepted according to Metropolis criterion. Overlap reduction run terminates as soon as all overlaps have been
# eliminated. Overlap reduction can output the same data as integration run, apart from ensemble averages.
